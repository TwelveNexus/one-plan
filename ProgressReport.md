- **Event-Driven Ready**: Webhook processing system in place
- **Security**: JWT authentication across services
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI for all services

### Key Features Implemented
1. **User Management**: Complete authentication and authorization system
2. **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant isolation and management
3. **Project Management**: Projects, tasks, and team collaboration
4. **AI-Ready Requirements**: Requirement analysis with AI scoring
5. **Visual Storyboarding**: Canvas-based story management with sharing

- Webhook signature verification for security

## Conclusion
The One Plan project has made excellent progress with 9 out of 12 core microservices now implemented. The architecture has proven to be scalable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and consistent patterns across services. The addition of the Requirement, Storyboard, and Integration services brings AI capabilities, visual planning, and external integrations to the platform. The next phase will focus on completing the remaining services (Notification, Analytics, and Subscription) and implementing cross-cutting concerns like service discovery and monitoring.
