# One Plan Project - Progress Report

## Project Overview
One Plan is an AI-enhanced project management platform being built with a microservices architecture. The system aims to revolutionize project planning through AI-powered features, multi-tenant capabilities, and comprehensive collaboration tools.

## Project Structure
We've established a comprehensive directory structure for the project:

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed

#### Identity Service Implementation
- **Core Service Structure**: Created the basic Spring Boot application structure with Java 21
- **Security Configuration**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with full user management
- **Database Integration**: Set up MariaDB connection with Flyway migrations for schema management
- **Environment Management**: Implemented .env file support for managing sensitive configuration
- **Error Handling**: Created global exception handler with proper HTTP responses
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/auth/login`: User authentication endpoint
  - `/auth/signup`: New user registration
  - `/auth/refresh`: JWT token refresh
  - `/users/**`: User management endpoints with role-based permissions

#### Tenant Service Implementation
- **Core Service Structure**: Created Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr
- **Model Design**: Implemented Tenant entity with UUID handling and proper JPA configuration
- **Repository Layer**: Created JPA repository with custom query methods
- **Service Layer**: Implemented service interface and implementation with proper validation
- **API Controller**: Created RESTful API endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- **Database Schema**: Set up database migration using Flyway
- **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI with OpenAPI configuration
- **Error Handling**: Implemented global exception handling for consistent error responses

#### Organization Service Implementation
- **Core Service Structure**: Created Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr
- **Model Design**: Implemented three key entities - Organization, Team, and TeamMember
- **Repository Layer**: Created JPA repositories with relationship handling
- **Service Layer**: Implemented service interfaces and implementations for all entities
- **API Controllers**: Created RESTful API endpoints for all three domains
- **Database Schema**: Set up complex schema migration with foreign key relationships
- **API Documentation**: Configured Swagger UI with entity-specific API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive exception handling

#### Development Environment
- **Project Structure**: Established a structured monorepo organization for all microservices
- **Database Management**: Implemented proper schema versioning with Flyway
- **Security Features**: Added JWT-based authentication with proper token handling
- **API Documentation**: Standardized OpenAPI documentation across services

### ⏳ In Progress

#### Integration Between Services
- Working on service-to-service communication strategy
- Planning shared authentication and authorization approach

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Project Service**: Implement the Project Service as the next crucial component
2. **Service Discovery**: Set up service discovery mechanism for inter-service communication
3. **API Gateway**: Implement the API Gateway to provide a unified API entry point

### Upcoming Microservices
1. **Project Service**: For project management (Priority: High)
   - Project CRUD operations
   - Project configuration and settings
   - Project analytics and reporting

2. **Task Service**: For task management (Priority: Medium)
   - Task CRUD operations
   - Task assignment and status tracking
   - Comments and activity tracking

### Future Enhancements
- **Test Implementation**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests (currently skipped)
- **Docker Development Environment**: Create Docker Compose setup for local development (currently skipped)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana integration for system monitoring
- **AI Integration**: Connection to external AI services for requirement analysis

## Technical Details

### Identity Service Architecture
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 21
- **Database**: MariaDB 11.2+
- **Dependencies**:
  - Spring Security with JWT
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Flyway for migrations
  - Lombok for boilerplate reduction
  - SpringDoc OpenAPI for documentation
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token support

### Tenant Service Architecture
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 21
- **Database**: MariaDB 11.2+
- **Dependencies**:
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Web
  - SpringDoc OpenAPI
  - Flyway for migrations
  - Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- **API Endpoints**:
  - CRUD operations for tenants
  - Tenant lookup by domain

### Organization Service Architecture
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 21
- **Database**: MariaDB 11.2+
- **Dependencies**:
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Web
  - SpringDoc OpenAPI
  - Flyway for migrations
  - Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- **Key Entities**:
  - Organization (top-level entity)
  - Team (belongs to an organization)
  - TeamMember (belongs to a team)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Complete CRUD operations for all entities
  - Specialized team member management

### Current Challenges
- UUID handling in MariaDB and Hibernate
- Service-to-service communication strategy
- Implementing proper tenant isolation across services

## Conclusion
The One Plan project has made significant progress with three core microservices implemented: Identity, Tenant, and Organization services. Each follows a consistent architectural approach with proper separation of concerns. We're using Spring Initializr to bootstrap new services efficiently, focusing on core functionality development while maintaining a high standard of code quality and API design. The next phase will focus on implementing the Project Service and establishing robust inter-service communication.
