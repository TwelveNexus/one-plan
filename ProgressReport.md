### Current Challenges
- Service-to-service communication strategy
- Implementing proper tenant isolation across services
- Maintaining consistency in data models across services
- Managing distributed transactions

## Database Schema
Each service has its own database:
- `oneplan_identity`: User authentication and profiles
- `oneplan_tenant`: Tenant management
- `oneplan_organization`: Organizations and teams
- `oneplan_project`: Projects and configurations
- `oneplan_task`: Tasks and comments

## Conclusion
The One Plan project has made significant progress with six core microservices implemented: API Gateway, Identity, Tenant, Organization, Project, and Task services. Each follows a consistent architectural approach with proper separation of concerns. The API Gateway provides a unified entry point for all services with JWT authentication. We're using Spring Initializr to bootstrap new services efficiently while maintaining high standards of code quality and API design. The next phase will focus on implementing the Requirement Service with AI integration and establishing robust inter-service communication.
