# One Plan Project - Progress Report

## Project Overview
One Plan is an AI-enhanced project management platform being built with a microservices architecture. The system aims to revolutionize project planning through AI-powered features, multi-tenant capabilities, and comprehensive collaboration tools.

## Project Structure
We've established a comprehensive directory structure for the project:

## Build System
We are using Gradle as our build system for all microservices.

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed

#### Identity Service Implementation
- **Core Service Structure**: Created the basic Spring Boot application structure with Java 21
- **Security Configuration**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with full user management
- **Database Integration**: Set up MariaDB connection with Flyway migrations for schema management
- **Environment Management**: Implemented .env file support for managing sensitive configuration
- **Error Handling**: Created global exception handler with proper HTTP responses
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/auth/login`: User authentication endpoint
  - `/auth/signup`: New user registration
  - `/auth/refresh`: JWT token refresh
  - `/users/**`: User management endpoints with role-based permissions

#### Development Environment
- **Project Structure**: Established a structured monorepo organization for all microservices
- **Database Management**: Implemented proper schema versioning with Flyway
- **Security Features**: Added JWT-based authentication with proper token handling

### ⏳ In Progress

#### Identity Service Refinements
- Implementing OpenAPI documentation
- Enhancing error responses and edge case handling

#### Tenant Service Implementation
- Setting up initial service structure using Spring Initializr
- Creating data models and database schema

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **OpenAPI Integration**: Add Swagger UI for API documentation
2. **Complete Tenant Service**: Implement repository, service, and controller layers

### Upcoming Microservices
1. **Organization Service**: For organization management (Priority: High)
   - Organization CRUD operations
   - Team management
   - Permission management for organizations

2. **Project Service**: For project management (Priority: Medium)
   - Project CRUD operations
   - Project configuration and settings
   - Project analytics and reporting

### Future Enhancements
- **Test Implementation**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests (currently skipped)
- **Docker Development Environment**: Create Docker Compose setup for local development (currently skipped)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana integration for system monitoring
- **AI Integration**: Connection to external AI services for requirement analysis

## Technical Details

### Identity Service Architecture
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 21
- **Database**: MariaDB 11.2+
- **Dependencies**:
  - Spring Security with JWT
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Flyway for migrations
  - Lombok for boilerplate reduction
  - SpringDoc OpenAPI for documentation
- **Schema Design**: See `V1__Initial_Schema.sql` for database structure
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token support
- **Environment Management**: .env file for sensitive configuration

### Current Challenges
- UUID handling in MariaDB and Hibernate
- Spring Security configuration for proper error responses
- Ensuring proper tenant isolation in future services

## Conclusion
The One Plan project has established a solid foundation with the identity service and is now expanding to implement the tenant service. We are using Spring Initializr to bootstrap new services and following a consistent architectural approach across all microservices. While testing and containerization are temporarily deferred, we maintain focus on core functionality development with plans to add these important aspects in future iterations.
